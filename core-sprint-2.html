    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>My long-term goal would be to become a full-stack developer and be able to create programs that will help people. I'm studying at Dev Academy, so that's a start.</p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>My strengths are creativity, attention to detail, and innovation. They are crucial for learning. Learning new things excites me as it allows me to be more creative. Attention to detail helps me understand better, and with an innovative mindset, when I'm stuck with obstacles, I can develop a new idea or method to overcome the challenges.<br>
          I am a very motivation-dependent person. I struggle when there are no challenges to motivate me, I tend to lose momentum and interest in things. I always try to look for new challenges to keep the momentum going. Learning web development will keep my motivation going as it requires constant problem-solving and overcoming challenges that lead me to think creatively.</p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I would like to work more on my organising and time management skills as remote learning is new to me, and I find it challenging to manage it well. </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
      <p>Communication and hard work are the keys to working productively and safely with others.
        I will make my efforts to communicate with others and work hard to keep up with the programme.</br>
         When things are building up and starting to get to me,  I would communicate more with facilitators and ask for help if needed. </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>I will seek help from others and facilitators in discord by asking questions in appropriate channels or messaging directly.</p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilittion team</h3>
      <p>I would expect the facilitation team to be my good supporter. Please help me through the course whenever I need help or guidance.</p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p> I don't have a family to care for as I'm living alone, and I'm not working now to dedicate my time to this course.</p>
