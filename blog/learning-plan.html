    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I want to use the skills I gain during this course to become a programmer who can work in any environment given.
      I would love to be a part of a team with an innovative mind and work towards improving people's quality of life.
      Programming is fun and challenging; I would like it to stay that way so I can live a dream life where I have a job that I enjoy!
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>My strengths are creativity, attention to detail, and innovation. 
      They are helpful in learning, but I believe my tenacity for problem-solving is my biggest strength, when I'm stuck on a problem, I don't stop until I figure out. 
      During the foundation, I discovered I lack skills in time management. 
      As the BootCamp is structured to have a specific time for lecture and pair programming, my lack of time management skills will not be a significant limitation as it did during the foundation. 
      But it is something I really need to work on during the Bootcamp. 
      My other limitation would be I struggle when there are no challenges to motivate me, but programming is all about challenges, so that It won't hinder me during the Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      I would have a lot of non-technical challenges during the Bootcamp, as I'm an introvert who is not a social person. 
      I would be doing pair programming daily with different people, and speaking in front of the group might make me nervous. 
      Although I tend to work well in a team environment, it will still be a challenge.
    </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I want to develop my communication skills and improve my self-awareness and reflective skills.
      I would say I'm pretty weak in Emotional intelligence, which is why I chose Dev-Academy over other choices.
      I believe it is more important than my coding skills as it is essential in a team environment, especially in a real-life job. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations from the Boocamp Team?</h3>
    <p>
      I expect the Bootcamp team to be mentors. Provide guidance, motivation, constructive feedback, and role modeling to help keep me on track.
    </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      I know that the Bootcamp will be very intensive and can be overwhelming at times. 
      I will seek help from others and facilitators before I'm overloaded and communicate consistently about how I feel and am doing. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I would eat well, work out, and have a good rest to maintain a healthy body and mind, work hard, and I will make my efforts to communicate with others and facilitators to work productively and safely.
      <br>
      <br>
      I want myself to be entirely focused on the Bootcamp and learn everything I can from others and facilitators so that I won't have any regret after the course is finished.
      <br>

    <h1>Foundation Learning plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>My long-term goal would be to become a full-stack developer and be able to create programs that will help people. I'm studying at Dev Academy, so that's a start.</p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>My strengths are creativity, attention to detail, and innovation. They are crucial for learning. Learning new things excites me as it allows me to be more creative. 
        Attention to detail helps me understand better, and with an innovative mindset, when I'm stuck with obstacles, I can develop a new idea or method to overcome the challenges.<br>
        I am a very motivation-dependent person. I struggle when there are no challenges to motivate me, I tend to lose momentum and interest in things. I always try to look for new challenges to keep the momentum going. Learning web development will keep my motivation going as it requires constant problem-solving and overcoming challenges that lead me to think creatively.</p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I would like to work more on my organising and time management skills as remote learning is new to me, and I find it challenging to manage it well. </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
      <p>Communication and hard work are the keys to working productively and safely with others.
        I will make my efforts to communicate with others and work hard to keep up with the programme.</br>
         When things are building up and starting to get to me,  I would communicate more with facilitators and ask for help if needed. </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>I will seek help from others and facilitators in discord by asking questions in appropriate channels or messaging directly.</p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilittion team</h3>
      <p>I would expect the facilitation team to be my good supporter. Please help me through the course whenever I need help or guidance.</p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p> I don't have a family to care for as I'm living alone, and I'm not working now to dedicate my time to this course.</p>
