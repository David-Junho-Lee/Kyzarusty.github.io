    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <img src="../images/neuroplasticity.webp">
    <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due to experience. 
      Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability, which is defined as being "easily influenced, trained, or controlled" 
      Neuro refers to neurons. These nerve cells are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system.
      Neuroplasticity, aka Brain Plasticity, has two main types: functional plasticity and structural plasticity.
    <ul>
    <li>Functional plasticity is the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas.
    </li>
    <li>Structural plasticity is the brain's ability actually to change its physical structure as a result of learning,
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>What's the benefits of Neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
    <li>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</li>
    <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
    <li>Strengthening areas where a function is lost or has declined</li>
    <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
    <p>
    Every day of our life involves learning. As I'm currently studying at Dev-Academy, 
    stimulating my brain through learning a new code language, challenging problem solving, 
    and focused attention will help encourage my brain to adapt and change.
    Sleeping well, exercising regularly, and meditating also increase and enhance neuroplasticity.

    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
    <img src="../images/growth-mindset.jpg">
    <h3>What is a growth Mindset?</h3>
    <p>
      A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenges and don't see failure as a way to describe yourself 
      but as a springboard for the growth and development of your abilities. 
      Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a fixed mindset?</h3>
    <p>
      A fixed mindset is a fundamental belief that you can't change your talents, traits, and basic abilities. 
      People with a fixed mindset tend to give up easily as no effort or hard work will impact their achievements.
    </p>
    <h3>benefits of a growth mindset</h3>
    <p>
      Individuals that foster a growth mindset can tackle complications, overcome obstacles, and work harder to find success. 
      They don't give up easily and understand that setbacks don't indicate that they are not good enough.
    </p>
    <h3>How having a growth mindset will affect your learning?</h3>
    <p>
      A growth mindset will help me through my learning as I perceive mistakes as opportunities to learn, try new and challenging things to grow, and knowing that improvements take time will keep me going until I achieve my goal.
