      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        I had a problem with the 'deBee' function in the Built-in Methods kata. 
        I was to make the words in an array all lowercase so I could filter them all out.
        I knew I was close to the solution, but the function wouldn't work. 
        I used Pseudocode, console logging, and googling to find out what I was doing wrong, 
        but they all failed to reach the solution.
        I was frustrated because I kept googling and trying to alter my code, 
        but none of them worked. 
        I finally gave up on solving it myself and seek for help on the discord tech-questions channel. 
        There was already athread on the problem, and I got a hint from the thread and reached the solution.
        I've learned that there is always a solution to a problem. 
        Even if you can't solve it yourself, help is around you; you just need to seek it.
      </p>

      <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
      <p>
        I wouldn't say elegantly, but the process went smoothly. 
        I jumped on JS-Olympics kata, stretch material for more practice,Â 
        and the time box suggestion was 6 hours. 
        I expected it to be long and painful, 
        but I got everything right after a few googling and reading error messages.
        I felt so good as I was pretty confident during the process and felt like my practices in previous kata were improving my skills. 
        So I elegantly solved all the problems on JS-Olympics kata in less than an hour, 
        and I learned that practices do not betray you.

      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
      <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
      <p>
        Pseudocode is very useful, it helps me to focus on small pieces of big puzzle, so I don't get lost during process.
        <br>It is relatively new to me and I'm not completely confident using it, 
        but it definitely help me to build code step by step.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Trying something</h4>
      <p>
        I use this technique most of the time as I want to solve problems on my own.
        <br>Trying something helps and works but I learnt that I need to stop being stubborn and 
        start asking questions more often.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
      <p>
        I'm not really a big fan of rubber ducky method,
        but I use similar technique which is talking to myself.
        <br>Talking to myself about problems helps me understand them better.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
      <p>
        Reading error messages can be a great help if the error messages directly informs me what I'm missing.
        <br>Even a simple syntax error message help me realize what I did wrong.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Console logging</h4>
      <p>
        My favourite type of problem solving techniques, as I can use it as a tool to display the outcomes.
        <br>I use it all the time to see where I'm at with the problem.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Googling</h4>
      <p>
        Googling is a god-send to problem solving when it comes to coding. 
        <br>When I come across new feature,
        I always google to find out and understand it before I began to try solve problems.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Asking your peers/facilitators for help</h4>
      <p>
        This is something I lack, I'm too focused on solving problems on my own.
        <br>If I'm stuck after trying many other problem solving techniques, I then seek for help, asking in discord.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
      <p>
        Even if I solved a problem using all the techniques mentioned above, if I don't understand how,
        <br>then I can't move on to next problem. I learn the most by reflecting process of solving problem.
