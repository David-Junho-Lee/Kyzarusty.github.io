    <h1>Foundation reflection</h1>
    <h3>What three new things have you learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
      <ul>
        <li>My EQ requires development</li>
        <li>I have a growth-mindset</li>
        <li>My strengths go well with programming</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>What are values, empathy, and self-awareness roles in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Values such as attention to detail and innovation help to enhance experience in learning and programming.
        Self-awareness helps you to be consistent and helps manage yourself when you face obstacles.
        Empathy is essential in programming as it helps you understand people better when working as a team.
      </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The amount of the core learning was more than I expected. 
        I didn't expect to spend so much time on the core part when I started this course. 
        I now understand why we had to spend a lot of time on the core part as it is essential for learning,  programming, and life.
      </p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Writing reflections. 
        I found it the most challenging to put reflections into words.<br>
        It is probably because of my lack of English writing skills, but I struggle a lot to tidy up my thoughts in writing.
      </p>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        It is essential for learning programming and life. 
        Core learning is like a root, whereas tech learning is like a tree. 
        Without the root, the tree won't survive.<br>
        I believe core learning will keep me going during and after I graduate.<br>
        In a real-life job situation, this is what I would rely on.
      </p>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>I would expect the facilitation team to be my good supporter. Please help me through the course whenever I need help or guidance.</p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p> 
        I don't believe it was a waste of time. 
        Of course, I could've developed more skills if I had spent time practicing programming. 
        However, in the long term, time spent on core learning will benefit me much more as it will enhance my learning and programming in much better way.
