    <h1>Identity, value and strengths</h1>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>

      <p>When I worked at a cafe, employees were responsible for filling in signing-in sheets. Many of my co-workers would lie about when they started and finished work. They were rostered to begin working at 7 am and were 10 minutes late, and they would still write the sign-in time as 7 am. 
      When filling in signing-in sheets, I've always been honest on sign-in / sign-out time, as integrity is one of my core values. Some of my co-workers disliked me doing this because they thought it was unimportant. But I chose integrity over little extra money.</p>
      
      <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
      
      <p>In Korea, we have Morality as a subject in school, just like maths, science, etc. Which I believe is unusual in other countries. Also, My parents are conservative Christian who believes integrity is a core value of life. When I was little, I would only get told off when I lied about things. Those things helped me build a foundation of my identity and what I value the most.</p>
      
      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
      
      <p>My strengths are creativity, attention to detail, and innovation. I believe they are crucial for a learning and web development career. Learning new things excites me as it allows me to be more creative. Attention to detail will help me identify problems quickly and develop a new idea or method to solve problems with an innovative mindset. Although all of my strengths are essential, there can be some downsides. Sometimes, too much attention to detail makes me a perfectionist, I can be slow to make decisions.</p>
      
      <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
      
      <p>I believe attention to detail and innovation will help me the most in my learning journey, as they are significant in solving problems and learning obstacles. I would focus on details to identify and solve the obstacle with an innovative mindset.
        
        “People with INTP preferences are independent problem solvers who excel at providing a detached, concise analysis of an idea or situation. They ask the difficult questions, challenging others and themselves to find new logical approaches.”</p>
      
      <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on wha tother strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      
      <p>When I was working at a busy cafe as a barista, my manager would bring her family in for free treats and sit down and chat with them even when we were very busy and needed help. I confronted her several times, but she kept doing whatever she wanted. I couldn't stand her being a bad role model to other employees, affecting their performance and mood, so I brought this up to the cafe owner. It wasn't effective as when the cafe owner or I was there, she pretended to work hard, but when both of us weren't there, she kept doing whatever she wanted. 
      I feel like the strategy I used was the right one because some people just don't change.</p>
