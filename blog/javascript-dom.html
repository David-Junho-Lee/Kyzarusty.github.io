      <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and it's relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>Building a website is like builing a house.
        <br>
        HTML is like the structure of the house(rooms, how many stories, etc)
        <br>
        CSS is about styling the house(colour of paints, materials etc).
        <br>
        Javascript is like the functionality of the house. It's about what you can do within the house. 
        <br>
        For example, you can eat, exercise, sleep, and watch a tv.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
      <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer excutes statement in a script and a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
        <br>
        <br>
        Control flow is like a routine in everyday life. You go for a morning run, take a shower, eat breakfast and go to work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whereas loops are like doing Dev-Academy foundation course.
        <br>

        <div class="tech-blog-list">
        <ol>
        <li>Study and learn weekly sprint</li>
        <li>If you haven't finished weekly sprint, or if you are unsure of the contents</li>
        <li>3. Go back to step 1</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>This loop is not going to stop until I finished the weekly sprint or I fully understand the contents.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>
      <p>The Document Object Model(DOM) is a programming interface for web documments. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page   
      </p>
      <br>
        <img src="../images/dom.jpg">
      <br>
         <p>We can access these elements in the document and make changes to them using JavaScript.
          </p>

         <img src="../images/dom-example2.png">
         <div class="tech-blog-sm">
         <p>An example of interacting elements in the document by using script attribute.</p>
         </div>
        <br>
        <br>
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>Arrays use zero-based indexing(first item in an array has a index of 0) and can be accessed by their numerical position in the list using bracket notation
        <img src="../images/access-array.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        Whereas objects use properties and can be accessed by their key in the list using either dot notation or bracket notation.
        <img src="../images/access-object.png">
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
      <p>Function is a block of reusable code to perform any particular task. Functions are useful as we can reuse them instead of writing same routine again and again. Also it helps to reduce debugging time as there will be less block of codes to deal with, end up saving a lot of time.</p>
